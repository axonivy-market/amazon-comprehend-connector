### How does it differ from ChatGPT?
If your primary goal is to perform **specific NLP tasks** like sentiment analysis or entity recognition on large volumes of text data, AWS Comprehend is a suitable choice. It offers pre-trained models, scalability, and **integration with the AWS ecosystem**. However, if you require a more **versatile language model** for open-ended conversations or generating human-like text, ChatGPT may be a better fit.
